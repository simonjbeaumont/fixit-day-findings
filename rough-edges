File any usuability issues here (not substantial/political enough to file as a bug)

- rrdd plugin failures spam the logs
- rrdd plugin failures don't log why the plugin couldn't be processed
- control domain is not renamed following host name change (I still have 'Control domain on host: localhost.localdomain') which is rather useless












Bangalore Observations
Probable Bugs:
1) Create a disk snapshot of VM -> Revert VM to snapshot -> Perform VM migration -> Throws error "VDI was not mapped to destination SR"
2) Create a checkpoint for Windows VM -> Create a New VM from checkpoint -> Throws error "VDI is in use by some other operation"


1. RPU precheck improvementf a VM on slave has 2 or more snapshots or 1 checkpoint, then it would not be able to migrate during RPU.IX: Check that condition in RPU precheck and give warnings accordingly.
2. Cannot see the dom0 console of trunk
3. No Disk mentioned in Performance tab of the VM in Disk section
4. Disk Perfomrance and Network performance of the VM not relaible
5. Socket leak on trunk after I tried to do 2 Live migrations and 1 SXM along with a snapshot of another VM. Si helping with this.
6. Creedence to Trunk RPU failed due to windows VM on slave not migrating during host evacuate. I am investigating it.
