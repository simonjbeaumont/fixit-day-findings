File any usuability issues here (not substantial/political enough to file as a bug)

- rrdd plugin failures spam the logs
- rrdd plugin failures don't log why the plugin couldn't be processed
- control domain is not renamed following host name change (I still have 'Control domain on host: localhost.localdomain') which is rather useless
